# Customized Surge Pro external rulesets

###### The Surge Pro external ruleset created because of personal needs. If you are using Quantumult X, the writing process is basically similar. I will gradually assemble relevant domestic and international websites into a few external rules lists according to my personal needs. The external ruleset currently defined includes: common social networking sites and my usual technical, academic and web resource sites，Includes many sites around the world with poor access speeds.

## Introduction
* If you also need to use these external rules, please click on the RAW button as shown below, a browser window will open, just copy the absolute address in the address bar and import it into Surge.

The address obtained at this point is：https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yagami1997/Surgerulesets/main/socialsite.list
### Detailed usage on Surge Pro
* First create a replica of the managed configuration and then enable it. In "Outbound Mode" select Proxy Rules, select Add Rule - Ruleset - External Ruleset
* Paste the address copied above into the URL of the external ruleset, e.g. the Github address of Sociallist.list is： https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yagami1997/Surgerulesets/main/socialsite.list
* Single policy just choose one you need according to your existing policy group, such as Proxy, Outside or others, and click Finish.
* How to update the external ruleset: Click the profile name in the main interface of Surge Pro to enter the profile configuration interface, in the edit section - External Resources, you can see the profile preset ruleset and the external rules you just imported, click Update All below to get the latest version.

### Future Plans
* I have recently developed a keen interest in Surge4 and Quantumult X. Considering the needs of many of my friends from China and Japan, I will look into adapting some common websites to my personal work and study by means of external Rule Sets, (although I basically don't need this list). Just because many people need it for their work and study, I may maintain this Rule Set for a long time.
* You can also download these list files, write your own private resource address, upload them to your own server, and give Surge Pro references with your own private URL for a little better privacy.

### Legal Disclaimer Notice
* I will not use this list to violate any national law,we will not use this listing for any commercial purposes
* Some rules refer to DL's rule set, thank you here.
* The format and content of this list is for reference and learning purposes only, I do not assume any legal responsibility for the reuse or secondary development of the list
